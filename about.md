*I like to read blogs and sexy PDFs all night and all day, mostly about some divine technique in some random language.
History, freedom and philosophy all shaped and formed in a computer geeks brain who's focused on building things with code.*

##Seriously what's this all about?
Yeah, well. During the daytime I work as a Software Engineer in Stockholm, Sweden.
It's pretty OK. Since I like to build (non-physical)things with code, test it, stress it, coffee it, reverse and break it, but **never** repeat it. Repetitions makes me sad.

At night, I pretty much do the same, but for my own amusement and that's why this web log (love that word) exists.
I guess I will read my own blog from time to time, but if some lonley browser pay this place a visit maybe it will leave a comment, hence disqus.
